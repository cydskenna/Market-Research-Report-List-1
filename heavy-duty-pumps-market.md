<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Heavy-Duty Pumps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centrifugal</li><li>Positive-Displacement</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The heavy-duty pumps market is primarily divided into two types: centrifugal and positive-displacement pumps. Centrifugal pumps utilize rotational energy to move fluids, ideal for high flow rates and low-viscosity liquids. Conversely, positive-displacement pumps work by trapping a fixed amount of fluid and forcing it through the discharge, making them suitable for high-viscosity fluids and precise flow control. Both types serve critical roles in various industries, including oil and gas, mining, and wastewater management, depending on the specific application requirements.</p></p>
